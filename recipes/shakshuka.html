        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shakshuka means ‘mix-up’ in Arabic and is found on many breakfast menus. It uses mostly store cupboard ingredients and is infinitely adaptable – try it as a healthy weekend breakfast or an easy dinner to use up any veg languishing in the fridge. Aubergine, feta or spicy sausage are all lovely additions.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>2 tbsp olive or sunflower oil</li>
                <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 heaped tbsp sun-dried tomato paste</li>
                <li>scant tsp caster sugar</li>
                <li>4 free-range eggs</li>
                <li>2 tbsp freshly chopped flatleaf parsley</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>pitta or crusty bread, to serve (optional)</li>

            </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a deep frying pan or sauté pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onions and fry for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic and chilli and fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer gently, without a lid, for 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the onion is tender. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
                <li>Using the back of a spoon, make four dips in the sauce and carefully crack an egg into each dip. Cover the pan with a lid and simmer over a gentle heat for about 6 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking.</li>
                <li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with some bread alongside (if using).</li>
            
            </ol>
