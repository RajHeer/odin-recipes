# odin-recipies

## About
A quick set of webpages. No fancy styling. Starting to work through elements of the Odin curriculumn and this specific [Recipies Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

## Skill learnt
Consolidating markdown skills. Hosting pages(s) from Github. Regular and clear commits on the repo from own machine following local setup and no longer working from Goorm container.
